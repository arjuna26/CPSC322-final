# Premier League Match Prediction

## Description

This project aims to predict the outcomes of Premier League matchups based on historical data from past seasons. The dataset, scraped from [fbref.com](https://fbref.com/), contains match data for over 2,281 games, including various attributes relevant to each game, such as team statistics, venues, formations, and match outcomes.

## Dataset

### Source
- Website: [fbref.com](https://fbref.com/)
- Scraping Process: HTML pages were requested and parsed using the `requests` library and `BeautifulSoup` to extract the relevant table data. The scraped data was then organized using `pandas` DataFrames.

### Attributes
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **date, time, comp, round, day, venue, result**: Details about the match, including date, time, competition, round, and venue.
- **gf, ga, opponent**: Goals scored for and against, along with the opposing team.
- **xg, xga, poss, attendance**: Advanced match statistics like expected goals, possession percentage, and attendance.
- **captain, formation, opp formation**: Team composition information such as the captain, team formation, and opponent's formation.
- **referee, match report, notes**: Additional match context, including the referee, match report, and notes.
- **sh, sot, dist, fk, pk, pkatt**: Match statistics related to shots, shot distance, free kicks, penalties, and penalty attempts.
- **season, team**: The season and team involved in the match.

### Classification Task
The project aims to classify the outcome of a future match based on this dataset. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a team winning, drawing, or losing their next match based on historical match data.

## Technical Implementation

### Tools and Libraries
- **requests** and **BeautifulSoup**: Used to scrape and parse data from fbref.com.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and organization.
  
### Anticipated Challenges
- **Data Imbalance**: Handling potential imbalances between match outcomes (win, lose, draw) to avoid biased predictions.
- **Feature Selection**: Selecting relevant features to improve model accuracy without overfitting.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning data and dealing with missing or inconsistent values.
  
### Potential Impact
The results of this project could provide insights into key factors that influence match outcomes. By making predictive models available to teams, analysts, and fans, stakeholders gain a better understanding of the dynamics of Premier League matches.

### Stakeholders
- **Sports Analysts and Enthusiasts**: Those interested in data-driven insights into team performance.
- **Sports Teams and Coaches**: May leverage predictions to inform strategy and analyze match factors.
- **Data Scientists and Machine Learning Practitioners**: Those looking to explore sports analytics and model classification tasks on sports data.
