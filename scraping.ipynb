    "# CPSC322 Final Project\n",

    "# Premier League Match Outcome Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Arjuna Herbst | Date: 11/11/2024 | Gonzaga University\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source and Format\n",
    "The dataset used in this project was scraped from [FBref](https://fbref.com/) using Python libraries BeautifulSoup and requests. The data is stored in CSV format using pandas, with each row representing a single Premier League match and containing various match details, team statistics, and outcome information. All code used to gather the dataset can be found below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contents\n",
    "The dataset includes 2281 instances with the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Date**: Date of the match\n",
    "- **Time**: Start time of the match\n",
    "- **Comp**: Competition type (e.g., Premier League)\n",
    "- **Round**: Round of the competition (e.g., Group Stage, Round of 16)\n",
    "- **Day**: Day of the week the match was played\n",
    "- **Venue**: Venue type, indicating if the match was played at home or away\n",
    "- **Result**: Outcome of the match (Win, Loss, or Draw)\n",
    "- **GF**: Goals scored by the team\n",
    "- **GA**: Goals allowed by the team\n",
    "- **Opponent**: Opposing team\n",
    "- **Opp Formation**: Formation used by the opponent\n",
    "- **Referee**: Referee who officiated the match\n",
    "- **Sh**: Total shots taken by the team\n",
    "- **SoT**: Shots on target\n",
    "- **Dist**: Average shot distance\n",
    "- **FK**: Free kicks taken\n",
    "- **PK**: Penalties scored\n",
    "- **PKatt**: Penalties attempted\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Attribute (Class Information)\n",
    "We aim to classify the **Result** of each match (Win, Loss, or Draw) based on the various match statistics and conditions provided. This will help us understand and predict the outcome based on factors like team performance, match venue, and opponent strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation/Technical Merit\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will involve:\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing or handling missing values, converting data types where necessary, and extracting relevant features from the raw data.\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing ones to improve the predictive power, such as recent team performance or opponent strength metrics.\n",
    "3. **Classification Algorithms**: Experimenting with multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors) to find the model that best predicts match outcomes.\n",
    "4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the models' performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anticipated Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Pre-processing**: Handling missing values, standardizing formats, and converting categorical features like `Comp` and `Opponent` into numerical representations.\n",
    "2. **Class Imbalance**: There may be more frequent outcomes (like Wins) compared to others (like Draws), which could affect model performance.\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection**: Some attributes may not contribute significantly to predicting the outcome. Techniques like correlation analysis or model-based feature selection will be explored to reduce dimensionality.\n",
    "4. **Noise in Data**: Attributes like referee or day of the week may introduce noise rather than useful information, so careful consideration will be needed to include or exclude such features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Impact of the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usefulness of Results\n",
    "Predicting match outcomes can offer insights into team performance and game strategy. Sports analysts, betting agencies, and even coaching staff may find value in understanding the factors that contribute to a match result. Additionally, fans may find it interesting to see how statistical factors can affect match outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "1. **Sports Analysts and Statisticians**: Professionals interested in identifying patterns in match data and understanding predictors of success or failure in sports.\n",
    "2. **Betting Agencies**: Companies that offer betting options on football matches could use these insights to set odds more accurately.\n",
    "3. **Coaches and Team Staff**: Insights could help teams adjust strategies based on factors that influence winning chances.\n",
    "4. **Fans**: Football enthusiasts interested in analytics and predictive insights may find this project engaging.\n"
